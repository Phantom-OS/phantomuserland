title SnapShot Sequence

Kernel->PersistentMemory: Forced page out request
note right of PersistentMemory: Writes unmodified pages to disk
note right of Kernel: 1-20 sec
Kernel->VirtualMachine: Stop all threads
note right of VirtualMachine: Saves VM states to memory, stops
note right of Kernel: 10-20 msec
Kernel->PersistentMemory: Disable write access
note right of Kernel: 1 msec
Kernel->VirtualMachine: Continue all threads
note right of VirtualMachine: Runs as usual, total pause is ~20 msec
Kernel->PersistentMemory: Page out modified pages
note right of PersistentMemory: Writes modified pages to disk
VirtualMachine->PersistentMemory: Write request (page fault)
note right of PersistentMemory: 
Makes duplicate of page
Opens write access to new copy of page
end note
PersistentMemory->VirtualMachine: return from page fault, continue
note right of PersistentMemory: 
Starts writing unmodified copy of page 
to disk, on success deletes unmodified copy
end note
PersistentMemory->Kernel: Done writing all modified pages
Kernel->PersistentMemory: Compare snapshot with previous one
note right of PersistentMemory: 
Finds out the difference
Builds list of pages on disk
Modifies disk superblocks to
point to new snapshot
Deletes pre-previous snapshot
end note
PersistentMemory->Kernel: Done
note right of Kernel: 
We did it.
Total time is 1-10 seconds,
Threads were stopped for 1-10 milliseconds.
