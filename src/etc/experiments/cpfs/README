Experimental simple and reliable FS code, not so connected to Phantom OS

JetOS howto:

ln -s <this directory> /...path-to-JetOS/examples/<copy-of-pure-arinc653-buffer/P1
cd there, scons, scons run


Questions:

- max disk size
- max file size
- have atime, mtime? (ctime is neary free)
- time variable format/unit/0 time?

- max num of concurrent io ops

- open/create timing depends on max file count in dir

TODO
- mark each func with max disk r/w ops count and max execution time on target CPU
- disk struct align - check field order and use GCC attributes?
- fsck
- multiple fs used concurrently (will fail now)
- r/w errors, not panic
- indirect blocks in inodes
